Gamification sounds fun, right? But I haven’t played any Souls-like game yet. Well... just dive in! :D

After spending the entire morning diving into the lore of Elden Ring, here's how I understand it:  
_Elden Ring_ functions like a programming console, defining the fundamental rules of _The Lands Between_ - life, death, and everything in between.  
_Erdtree_ is the result of _Elden Ring_'s execution. It represents a snapshot of those rules, applied to the inhabitants of _The Lands Between_.

And there are a few ideas to bring that epic vibe into our app:

1. Grace / Ashes (Web Link)  
   Users can collect _Graces_ as part of their knowledge journey. Over time, older _Graces_ might fade into _Ashes_ if they’re not updated or revisited, emphasizing the relevance. Graces can also form a tree-like structure, much like the branches of the _Erdtree_.
2. Great Rune (Category)  
   A _Great Rune_ is a shard of the _Elden Ring_, containing immense power and tied to the Shattering - the great holy war. Each Great Rune could be linked to multiple Graces or Ashes.
3. Seal (Enhanced web link)  
   In Elden Ring, Seals channel divine power or specific affinities. Similarly, enhanced web links amplify knowledge, just as Seals boost the power of incantations.
4. Spell (Code snippet)  
   Like casting a spell, code snippets are executable and repeatable. We could create a _Spellbook_ feature for easier access and sharing.
5. Incantation (User blog)  
   Encourage users to write blogs as if telling a tale of discovery, complete with thematic titles like "The Forge of Redis" or "Docker's Abyss".
