There are plenty of valuable resources for learning, such as books, courses, articles, and more. In my opinion, creating a new one isn't the best approach. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I intentionally gather these resources and add my own notes, making it easier for me to reference them later. As a next step, I can use AI to connect the dots semantically and integrate them into coding playgrounds like https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds.

List me your need?
1. **Quickly add a web link without any note or category** - These links will be stored in a place called *The Lands Between* (inspired by the game Elden Ring).
2. **Categorize a link with tags** - Add tags like #git, #redis, #event_loop to categorize links.
3. **Search relevant links by topic** - Allow searching for links using exact match to the topic.
4. **Document insights from specific links** - Create explanations or notes based on insights gathered from a particular link.
5. **Store self-written blogs** - Keep your own blogs, which may reference the collected links.
6. **Store reproducible code snippets** - Store code snippets that can be executed in a sandbox environment, such as a Docker container.
7. **Store visual diagrams** - Save diagrams to enhance the readability and clarity of content.
