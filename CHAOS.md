There are plenty of valuable resources for learning, such as books, courses, articles, and more. In my opinion, creating a new one isn't the best approach. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I intentionally gather these resources and add my own notes, making it easier for me to reference them later. As a next step, I can use AI to connect the dots semantically and integrate them into coding playgrounds like https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds.

List me your need?
1. **Quickly add a web link without any note or category** - These links will be stored in a place called *The Lands Between* (inspired by the game Elden Ring).
2. **Categorize a link with tags** - Add tags like #git, #redis, #event_loop to categorize links.
3. **Search relevant links by topic** - Allow searching for links using exact match to the topic.
4. **Document insights from specific links** - Create explanations or notes based on insights gathered from a particular link.
5. **Store self-written blogs** - Keep your own blogs, which may reference the collected links.
6. **Store reproducible code snippets** - Store code snippets that can be executed in a sandbox environment, such as a Docker container.
7. **Store visual diagrams** - Save diagrams to enhance the readability and clarity of content.

Gamification sounds fun, right? But I haven’t played any Souls-like game yet. Well... just dive in! :D

After spending the entire morning diving into the lore of Elden Ring, here's how I understand it:  
*Elden Ring* functions like a programming console, defining the fundamental rules of *The Lands Between* - life, death, and everything in between.  
*Erdtree* is the result of *Elden Ring*'s execution. It represents a snapshot of those rules, applied to the inhabitants of *The Lands Between*. 

And there are a few ideas to bring that epic vibe into our app:
1. Grace / Ashes (Web Link)  
Users can collect *Graces* as part of their knowledge journey. Over time, older *Graces* might fade into *Ashes* if they’re not updated or revisited, emphasizing the relevance. Graces can also form a tree-like structure, much like the branches of the *Erdtree*.
2. Great Rune (Category)  
A *Great Rune* is a shard of the *Elden Ring*, containing immense power and tied to the Shattering - the great holy war. Each Great Rune could be linked to multiple Graces or Ashes.
3. Seal (Enhanced web link)  
In Elden Ring, Seals channel divine power or specific affinities. Similarly, enhanced web links amplify knowledge, just as Seals boost the power of incantations.
4. Spell (Code snippet)  
Like casting a spell, code snippets are executable and repeatable. We could create a *Spellbook* feature for easier access and sharing.
5. Incantation (User blog)  
Encourage users to write blogs as if telling a tale of discovery, complete with thematic titles like "The Forge of Redis" or "Docker's Abyss".
