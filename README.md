This project was created to provide my student with an in-depth understanding of backend development. At the time, I didn't know much about her desires and expectations, or how I could help her achieve those goals. So, I simply wrote down my thoughts and explored the process along the way

## Vision

There are plenty of valuable resources for learning, such as books, courses, articles, and more. In my opinion, creating a new one isn't the best approach. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I intentionally gather these resources and add my own notes, making it easier for me to reference them later. As a next step, I can use AI to connect the dots semantically and integrate them into coding playgrounds like https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds.

## Capabilities

List me your need?

1. **Quickly store a web link without any note or category** - These links will be stored in a place called _The Lands Between_ (inspired by the game Elden Ring).
2. **Categorize a link with tags** - Add tags like #git, #redis, #event_loop to categorize links.
3. **Document insights from specific links** - Add explanations or notes based on insights gathered from a particular link.
4. **Search links by tags**
5. **Search links containing the queried text**
6. **Search relevant links by keywords** â€“ Enable searching for links using an exact match semantic to the topic, similar to the BM25 algorithm.
