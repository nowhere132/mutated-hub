### EXISTENTIAL CRISIS

A customer walks into your coffee shop and orders a cup of coffee. She communicates with the waiter, chooses one or more drinks, pays for the order, and waits for the drinks to be prepared. The waiter sends the order to you, waits until the drink is magically made (as if by thin air), and then politely delivers it to the customer.

As a barista (or a backend developer, really, not much different), you do your own tricks behind the scenes to deliver the drink, no matter what's happening around you. Sounds easy, right? A kid could also do it. So why do you even need to be there?
Things start to get complicated when:

- You need to serve thousands of customers at once or in a short time span. Now, you have to redefine what "serving" mean and figure out how to break it down so you can still deliver a similar level of happiness to your customers.
- Your coffee machine breaks, and you need to keep operations running without any prior guidance on how to manage the situations. Always have a backup plan, especially when dealing with a reasonable number of customers.
- Your kitchen is small, and your boss didn't hire "enough" employees. He wants to generate a lot of revenue but avoid the same level of costs. Unfortunately, this is a daily reality.
- You're not a coffee expert. Who knows what will happen when you mix the ingredients in the wrong order? It won't explode immediately, but may cause one in your customer's stomach :D
- You are a coffee expert, but your customers still complain that you ruined their day. How can you ensure your product is good and didn't cause harm? Logging, tracing, and digital signing are just a few ways to keep track.

And the list goes on, especially when you factor in the internal human dynamics that often go unnoticed. Just remember, the devil is in the details.
